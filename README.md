### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
stixx is an hobby project to get more knowledge about graphics programming as well as other principles related to game engine development.
I started this journey without any experience on gpu programming. However C++ programming is what i do professionally.
the goal is to have some components in place to create an MVP game.
non functional requirements:
- platform independant
- to have a graphics abstraction in place. (strating with an vulkan implementation)
- nicely decoupeled cohesive components and modules with 100% code coverage.
